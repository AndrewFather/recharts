The **htmlwidgets** package has made it much easier to port JavaScript libraries into R, and these libraries can be used in both static R Markdown documents and Shiny apps. This **recharts** package was designed using **htmlwidgets**, which can save us (developers) a lot of time on managing JavaScript dependencies and dealing with different types of output documents such as R Markdown and Shiny.

The main function in this package is the `echart()` function (an S3 generic function), and the goal is to make it smart enough to deal with different types of R data automatically. For example, when a data frame is passed to `echart()`, and the `x`/`y` variables are numeric, it should automatically figure out that you probably need a scatterplot, and the axes will be automatically generated. Of course, you can also override the automatic guess. Here are some quick examples:

```{r}
library(recharts)
# you can also write: iris %>% echart(~Sepal.Length, ~Sepal.Width)
echart(iris, ~Sepal.Length, ~Sepal.Width)
echart(iris, ~Sepal.Length, ~Sepal.Width, series = ~Species)
```


Given that ECharts supports so many types of charts, it may take a while for us to make `echart()` really smart. With that in mind, we also provided a really low-level S3 method defined for lists. Since the main usage of ECharts is that you pass a JavaScript object to the method `.setOption()`, and we can construct such an object using a list in R. This low-level `echart.list()` method makes it possible for you to create arbitrary charts. Here is a simple example of a Chord diagram taken from http://echarts.baidu.com/doc/example/chord1.html:

```{r}
chordEx1 = list(
  title = list(
    text = '测试数据',
    subtext = 'From d3.js',
    x = 'right',
    y = 'bottom'
  ),
  tooltip = list(
    trigger = 'item',
    formatter = JS('function(params) {
      if (params.indicator2) { // is edge
        return params.value.weight;
      } else {// is node
        return params.name
      }
    }')
  ),
  toolbox = list(
    show = TRUE,
    feature = list(
      restore = list(show = TRUE),
      magicType = list(show = TRUE, type = c('force', 'chord')),
      saveAsImage = list(show = TRUE)
    )
  ),
  legend = list(
    x = 'left',
    data = c('group1', 'group2', 'group3', 'group4')
  ),
  series = list(
    list(
      type = 'chord',
      sort = 'ascending',
      sortSub = 'descending',
      showScale = TRUE,
      showScaleText = TRUE,
      data = list(
        list(name = 'group1'),
        list(name = 'group2'),
        list(name = 'group3'),
        list(name = 'group4')
      ),
      itemStyle = list(
        normal = list(
          label = list(show = FALSE)
        )
      ),
      matrix = rbind(
        c(11975,  5871, 8916, 2868),
        c( 1951, 10048, 2060, 6171),
        c( 8010, 16145, 8090, 8045),
        c( 1013,   990,  940, 6907)
      )
    )
  )
)

echart(chordEx1)
```

Apparently all we did was to translate the JavaScript object in the [original example](http://echarts.baidu.com/doc/example/chord1.html) into R. Note we translated the function `tooltip.fomatter` using the `JS()` function in **htmlwidgets**. All other objects can be mapped naturally to R.

Hopefully you see the two extremes in the design now:

1. We want `echart()` to be really smart so you do not need to think about the ECharts options (the JavaScript object). You just use the function like other R plotting functions, and we take care of as many gory details as we can under the hood.
1. Before we get there, you can always fall back to the `echart.list()` method, which probably does not make much sense to most R users, but it works anyway.

This is a project that I (Yihui) started last year in a couple of days, but it is difficult for me to find more time to continue working on it. Perhaps I can come back in a few months, but I wish someone else can follow my thoughts, and fill out the blanks. I only tested scatterplots as a proof-of-concept. I do not think it is terribly difficult to support other types of charts. You just need patience to read the documentation of ECharts, and careful thinking on what the _natural_ syntax is for R users to create charts, assuming the users do not understand JavaScript or ECharts at all.
